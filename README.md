# Pre-work - *Tudu*

**Tudu** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Antonio J. Roa-Valverde**

Time spent: **~6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [x] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [x] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [x] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** I love the way things get done in Android. In my opinion, the UI approach in Android is more intuitive than in other Web frameworks like JSF.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** This solution uses a RecyclerView and therefore does not implement an ArrayAdapter directly. In general, in Android adapters are used as a middleman between the view system and the data. Adapter are responsible for creating a view for each item available in the dataset.

## Notes

This app doesn't follow the guideline available at [http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/prework.md]. Instead the following alternatives have been implemented:
* Use of RecyclerView.
* Use of [Schematic](https://github.com/SimonVT/schematic) for generating the ContentProvider and the necesary code for dealing with SQLite.
* Swipe gestures for deleting items directly from the RecyclerView.
